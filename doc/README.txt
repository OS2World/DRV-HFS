What is HFS/2
=============

HFS/2 is a program which lets OS/2 users read and write files on
diskettes formatted with the Hierarchical File System used on
Macintosh computers.  With HFS/2, Macintosh diskettes can be used
just as if they were ordinary diskettes.


Important note
==============

This program is in an early, experimental stage, and may still have many
bugs and problems.

Please read all of this information before attempting to use the program.
The file can be viewed by typing

at an OS/2 prompt.
